The database I used for this visualization is the SuperStoreUS 2015. Even though it is the most common dataset on the Internet and it is not updated, I think it is still a good practice to make data visualization attractive and easy to understand.
This visualization is about finding what kind of product category has the highest sales in any state in the United States. I have added 3 new measures to calculate total sales, total profit, and profit margin.

In conclusion, we can observe that technology has the highest sales compared to the other product categories in the database, followed by furniture and office supplies. In the category of technology, most of the sales generated from the technology category are office machines.
